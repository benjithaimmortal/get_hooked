# Hi there! You're learning about WordPress hooks

Welcome! Make yourself at home; browse around.

## What's this theme about?

It's a really simple implementation to show off WordPress hook actions and filters.

The `functions/` directory contains files that are linked in `functions.php`

The `scripts/` directory contains scripts that are enqueued in WordPress.

The `templates/` directory contains my custom page templates, for demoing the functionality and showing my code during the conference.

Sometimes you'll need a plugin to make this theme work as expected. I installed:
  - [Advanced Custom Fields [paid]](https://advancedcustomfields.com/)
  - [Ajax Load More [free]](https://connekthq.com/plugins/ajax-load-more/)
  - _and nothing else_
